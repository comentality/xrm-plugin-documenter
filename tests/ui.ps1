# Screenshots the tool's UI at a few window sizes, without XrmToolBox and without a connection.
#
# The layout is built in code and most of it only misbehaves at a size you did not try, so this
# hosts PluginDocumenterControl in a bare form, fills it with sample rows and grabs a PNG per size.
# Shots land in tests\.ui and are overwritten each run.
#
#   .\ui.ps1                          # default sizes
#   .\ui.ps1 -Size 1600x1000          # one size
#   .\ui.ps1 -Size 1280x900,820x620   # several
#   .\ui.ps1 -NoBuild                 # reuse the last build
#   .\ui.ps1 -Docs                    # regenerate the two screenshots in the README
#
# It drives the real control, so it screenshots real bugs: a splitter that throws while being set
# up shows here as a failed run rather than as a broken tab in XrmToolBox.
#
# -Docs writes assets\ui-attributes.png and assets\ui-comment.png, which README.md and docs\ point
# at. They are the same control and the same sample data as every other shot; only the window
# title, the source folder shown in the box and the output mode differ, so a change to the layout
# turns up in the README by re-running this rather than by somebody remembering to.

.SYNOPSIS
    Removes everything register.ps1 put in the environment.

.DESCRIPTION
    Deletes all three fixture solutions, companion first. Because they are managed,
    deleting them takes the steps, images, plugin types and the assemblies themselves with
    them - which an unmanaged solution would not: its components stay behind in the
    Default solution.

    The publishers the solutions were imported under are left alone. They own nothing once
    the solutions are gone, and pac has no command for deleting one.

    A solution that is not there is not an error; this is safe to run at any time.

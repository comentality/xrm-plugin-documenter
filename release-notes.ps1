# The rule the changelog and the store agree on: a top-level bullet whose lead sentence is
# bolded is user-facing and ships; a bullet without a bolded lead stays in the repo. That is
# why the bolded lead has to say what changed and stand on its own — in the store there is no
# paragraph under it and no screenshot beside it.
#
# Everything that is XrmToolBox rather than Plugin Step Codegen lives in the XtbSandbox
# module (github.com/comentality/xrmtoolbox-sandbox), shared with the other tools.
